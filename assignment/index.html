  <li>HELP I'm struggling how to understand/remember where I must put semicolons vs where they RUIN MY LIFE FOREVERRRRR</li>
  <li>When can/should declarations be made inside of a loop? Best practice is to minimize global declarations, right?</li>
  <li>Edit: I think I got the answer to this, and what I gather is yes it's just convention. => I'm not totally clear on when "i" as in i=0 must be i, or if it's just a convention. Or, what are instances where it would typically NOT be named i?</li>
